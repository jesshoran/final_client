### Explanations of technologies used

Made a CRUD app using: React, Ruby on Rails, SQL, Material UI, HTML, CSS and Boostrap.

### Approach

I started out using by just creating my my own database of moves that you can do at home (all bodyweight). From then, I created custom routes to display my 5 desired workouts: HIIT, Low Impact, Leg Day, Core Blast and a Mix- Surprise Me! 

### Unsolved Problems

I wouldn't say unsolved, but some things I'd like to change in the future:
-   Authentication for the users
-   Ways to track progress
-   Timer


### User Stories

Users can add view all types of moves and learn, as well as perform multiple types of workouts.

### Notes
-   Add members as carousel across the homepage- check out our community type thing
-   Events
-   Combine with Beats Body
